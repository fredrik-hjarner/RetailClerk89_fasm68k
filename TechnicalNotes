Unsorted technical / development notes

These are here because:

a) This is my first attempt to code a Sega Genesis game and there are tons of mistakes and oddities - too many for me to remember so I have to write them down 

b) If anyone were to try using this code for an different game this is the stuff most likely to trip them up

Some day I might turn this into a real development document.

- How to add new NPCs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I realized I officially made the project structure too complex when I started trying to add new NPCs to each location. There are 8 steps involved in this mess.

1) Create the actual tiles. Due to how the tiles are loaded into the VPD and turned into a sprite, each 16x32 tile is mapped like:
  0  4
  1  5
  2  6
  3  7
This code is hard-wired to having all the characters be 16x32. Supporting other sprite sizes is not impossible but also not zero effort. The sprite frames need to be ordered like:
 Down frame 0,1,2
 Up frame 0,1,2
 Left frame 0,1,2
 Right frame 0,1.2
This code is also hard-wired to 3 frames per direction. Same disclaimer as above.

2) Add a reference to the new tiles in inc_tiles

3) Update the scene definition for the scene this NPC will appear in. Sometimes this is optional. 

4) Update InitNPCLocations to place this NPC in a scene. This is optional if the NPC doesn't appear in any scene at the start of the game. 

5) Add a new entry to data_CharacterDefinitions

6) Add a new entry to table_Text to map the NPC name to a string

7) Add the actual string to the strings file

8) Add a new entry in const_ObjectIDs
